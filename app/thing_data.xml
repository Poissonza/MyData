        <description>Description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In
            The Colonists, a.k.a. Die Kolonisten, each player is a mayor of a village and must develop their environment
            to gain room for new farmers, craftsmen, and citizens. The main goal of the game is full employment, so
            players must create new jobs, educate the people, and build new houses to increase their population. But
            resources are limited, and their storage leads to problems that players must deal with, while also not
            forgetting to upgrade their buildings. Players select actions by moving their mayor on a central board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The
            Colonists is designed in different levels and scenarios, and even includes something akin to a tutorial,
            with the playing time varying between 30 minutes (for beginners) and 180 minutes (experts).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The

                     value="In the arena of logistics/resource conversion games, this is the closest contender to Ora &amp; Labora for what I&apos;m looking for that I&apos;ve played (compared to Neuland, Roads &amp; Boats, and Le Havre). First off, this has an almost dizzying decision tree in how wide it is with the various pathways, jumps, chaining of your three turns, etc. You can do just about anything you want and baring a couple of chokepoints (I think the CommunityHall being one), you can sort of do what you want and see how it works out. One thing that this does over R&amp;B is it&apos;s not passive-aggressive in it&apos;s confrontation (e.g. gold isn&apos;t sitting on donkeys for ownership). In that respect, where R&amp;B is logistics, O&amp;L settlement spatial &amp; resource conversions, it feels like The Colonists chooses instead to focus on the central map and connections that you want to make (in an optimized manner). Where Ora &amp; Labora shine for me as a 3 (or, with experienced players, 4p) game due to work contracts, this seems to have a linear play time based on players and works rather well as a 1 and 2p game. One thing I do appreciate in The Colonists over O&amp;L is the variability in when buildings come out within the era (as in O&amp;L, you can pick up the same building on your first turn if you plan well).That said, there are a couple things that annoy me about the game. It runs long, period. This is a game that would jump 2 points in my rating scheme if you could play a 3 era game in 3 hours or less (basically, the time frame of O&amp;L). In 3 games, I&apos;m still averaging a little under 90min per era when it feels like the game should realistically only consume 60 or less per. It overstays it&apos;s welcome in that regard. The era skipping feature is neat, but it almost takes as much time to skip the first era as it does to play it... Second, there isn&apos;t much driving diversification of strategy outside when buildings come out. Why would I not try and create a brewery district late in the game or skip theaters/casinos? (sure, there is a reason, but my point of &quot;if you don&apos;t know how to leverage that, there is nothing pushing you toward finding out&quot;). That&apos;s a by product of having such a wide open playing field, and some players who are more likely to latch onto a strategy and avoid trying something else will be disappointed. This is a game that requires &quot;self-starter&quot; gamers. I do think having a set of challenges (e.g. &quot;have the most glitzy entertainment district for an additional 10pts per building&quot; would have been neat as an alternate pathway to victory or variance). Last, the lack of interaction relegates this to a 2p game at most, it&apos;s surprising what a work contract in O&amp;L can do to create a pleasant euro-style interaction aspect.Overall, I&apos;m rather happy with the game and looking forward to seeing what Puls and company do with expansions. A strong 7.edit: weak 7. I&apos;ve now played a bunch of games and I think starting in era 3 with 2p is likely the optimum one (with starting in era 4 being the alternative). It still takes like 4 hours, but it&apos;s certainly manageable then. One thing that is notable is if you start in era 3, you&apos;re playing &quot;Setup: The Boardgame&quot; for the first 90min as you make a bunch of decisions on what you&apos;re doing. We did conquer the ultimate summit once; 4p &amp; 4 era game in a little under 11 hours (2 newbies). I do still like the game, and I think it has a place on the shelf as a companion piece to Ora &amp; Labora, but it&apos;s not my preferred of the two (I think because the spatial piece here is a backseat in terms of planning focus).Oh, and I think the existing expansions/promos aren&apos;t worth it, skip them. They pull the game in a very different direction than where I think it is interesting/entertaining.edit2: now that we&apos;ve played another ~10 games of the same opponents/starting era, and tried lots of different things for setup or strategies, I think it bumps up to a strong 7/weak 8 under those circumstances.edit3: A bump up to a weak 8. I&apos;m really quite impressed with it in terms of just how much planning and forethought goes into the game compared to Ora &amp; Labora. Now I wonder just how much better I can do than 59 building points and 8 embassy points if we start in era 2 instead of 3... Second, I wonder if some of the embassies are intended for higher player counts (e.g. The Lord one) or needs to not be in play with some of the others to shine."/>

                     value="This game has some good ideas, and some nice mechanics - I liked marching your pieces across the different tiles to activate them, and one player getting an option on where to place the new tiles in the map really added some interesting choices to the game. But it is just too long for what it is - we&apos;ve played the full game twice now, and shorter setups a handful of times more than that. The shorter games where you cut off entire eras just feels like you&apos;re playing an incomplete game, which is very unsatisfying. The full game has a proper game arc and a lot of strategy opened up by planning for the future - but the game just plods through it, and the pace feels awful. We&apos;re quick players, and it still dragged for us. I have no problem with long games that deliver something for that length - 1830, Here I Stand, etc. - but this just feels like a regular Euro experience you could get in a 90 minute game stretched out past the breaking point.The game&apos;s speed issues also make player count problematic. I&apos;d say 3-4 is the most &apos;fun&apos; or &apos;strategic&apos; - there is more choice, more competition, etc. Yet each player adds so much to the already significant length problems, that you&apos;re left not wanting to play with the higher player counts."/>

The embassy powers are pretty interesting and work well. I liked building on personal boards.DISLIKE: Fiddly, chit intensive. Tiny icons on the map tiles are difficult to read. Mostly multi-player solitaire. What a player&apos;s goal should be was not clear the first time through.OVERALL: I felt the first era could be skipped. It possibly could lead to some alternate strategy setups, but random pre-setup cards could do the same thing. I think the game is similar to Rosenberg&apos;s games, but less tight. Probably too slow of a game for me.Small comparisons to Istanbul."/>

                     value="This rating is for the introductory game on easy map. It feels a lot like la havre but much longer. Some Uwe Rosenberg mixed in. Overall it was pretty fun and more thinky I than I first anticipated after the tutorial. How the map is built, tiles and cards come out really change your game play. It&apos;s a lot more tactical but also requiring strategy to plan at least a round in advance to pull off your moves. something like la havre packs a pretty big punch in a short time so I have concerns about the length and the games ability to deliver that experience over each round. I can&apos;t speak to any of that get but I am looking forward to finding out. I also don&apos;t expect it will take 7-8 as some claim as we went pretty quick with two at era 1. I can&apos;t speak for certainties but seems maybe around 6 or least that&apos;s what I am hoping since that is dooable. I like the saving mechanics so we can jump into the other eras exactly where we left off or convert to dollars and change strategies of we did poorly. This game is certainly more niche than most due to the length a and eras but I think it will be one we enjoy occasionally but I don&apos;t expect it to get anywhere near the play of a finely tuned game that packs a punch in a shorter time. However I still find myself thinking about the moves or how I could have better adapted or pivoted to the changing board state."/>

Mechanism fine but tile lay out crucial.  First game, admittedly as newbie, I had no wood, could not get wood and could not move to any other location except the base tile without having wood.  Effectively lost three turns, momentum and any chance of being competitive.  Each player gets three turns together.  Allows for combinations but painfully slow.  Especially as one tile enable players to get and select cards, which they then need to read and then decide which ones to keep.  You can plan ahead to an extent, but quite often moves scuppered as you need to use a tile another player is occupying which requires additional costs.  The changing benefits of the home tiles and the board evolution worked well.  But the game was way too slow and offered very little in the way of new ideas or mechanics."/>

Fix 3 akció, a lépések a &quot;térképen&quot; a világ legegyszerűbb módján történnek, a kombózás mégis nagyon méllyé teszi. Ami tetszett, az a követségi rész, ami a random követségek miatt teljesen egyedivé teszi az egyes partikat (pl. egyik partiban könnyebb lesz nagyobb raktárt szerezni, a másikban az emberek színében kapunk segítséget stb.). A másik ami jó, hogy éreztem a játékban a fejlődést. Mi sajnos csak az első 2 kort játszottuk le, de a végén már éreztem, hogy a 3. korra muszáj lenne a sárga emberekre rágyúrni, és más szempontból is teljesen átjött a fejlődés, pl. ahogy az új épületek sorra jönnek be. A piac megoldása nagyon elegáns, biztosítja a változatosságot és hogy sose álljon be a játék. Szerintem 2-3 parti után egy teljes játék lemegy 2-3 óra/játékos alatt. Összességében ritka jó játéknak érzem, csupán az tart vissza a 9-10-es pontszámtól, hogy még csak fél partin vagyok túl. Nem is tudok így hirtelen hibáját mondani, talán csak a hosszú előkészület meg a nagy játékidő. A hossza meg a nagy játékdömping miatt megeshet, hogy nem is játszom már vele soha, pedig erre még talán rászánnék egyszer egy teljes napot is.

Towards the end of Era 2 you will suddenly see the importance of placing the Tiles and will feel punished for what you did in the first two Eras.It&apos;s a bit of setup work even if you are organised (10 minutes), putting everything back into the box is the worst part (about 15 minutes). Using the &quot;save game&quot; feature will certainly add to it but I haven&apos;t tried it, yet.However, it is a pretty good game. Be prepared to sacrifices a lot of table space. The real downside for me comes with the component quality. It is already in the higher price range but the Cards really are subpar standard, the Box itself feels really cheap. The Tiles (which there are plenty) are of good quality and so are the player boards. All player tokens are of acceptable quality.If only Stonemaier Games could have produced this game!!Did I regret the purchase ? Certainly not!! If you are looking for a Civilisation Building Game and don&apos;t mind longer gameplay than this is for you.Plays great solo and with 2 people.

                     value="Initial Impression: There are a TON of components in this game, with thick cardboard used for the chunky tiles. I find the graphic design for the components are above average but nothing too stellar, as the component&apos;s size limited the amount of room the designer had to put all relevant info on. As a result, my poor aging eyes had a difficult time seeing some of the iconography. This game is an interesting mix of engine building, vp optimization, with a spacial puzzle thrown into the mix. The main board grows at the end of every round, presenting the players with new  possibilities. Imagine a worker placement game where new worker spaces open up as the game progresses. There are a fair amount of resources which can be converted to other resources but somehow this doesn&apos;t feel as overwhelming as most Rosenberg games. Overall the game has a light feeling to it, with few calculations to be performed, but the decisions have a long term impact on the players&apos; performance in the game. And by long term, I mean LONG. This game can be played through 4 phases or &quot;eras&quot;. Your production decisions in one era will directly affect your performance in the next. There&apos;s a wonderful need to balance the short and long term gains. Personally, I believe the game is probably best experienced as a 4 era game since the sense of your colony&apos;s progression is so strong in this game.  "/>

Also two minor points : you can get easily cards, but it is hard to play a card (only one place if the right colony isn&apos;t in the game) and why the choice of doing 3 actions in a row : for that reason, there&apos;s a lot of downtime especially when one of your actions is taking cards."/>

                    value="I played 1 game - we got about 1/3 through starting by 8 and played 2.5 hours or so.  Really enjoyed it, lots of fun.  If this could be played on Yucata or Board Game Arena it would be a perfect fit for me.  Full of interesting choices, good spacial element, hugely satisfying.  I will never play a full game of this probably as I cannot really cope with the full length and not sure I have people who want want to play it over several sittings with me.  There are rules for shortened versions and I am not sure how they would work but the game itself is so much fun, lots of interesting choices whilst at the same time being fairly simple to begin with.Really well designed although the full game is a bit long for my tastes.  Lots of different ways to play and lots of variability baked in so I can see this being a game that can just be played and played."/>

                    value="This is an amazing, epic euro. Rules are easy to digest and teach while fitting the theme very well. The variability comes from where the hex tiles will be placed and which 4  of the 9 colonies will used for the game (adding a 5th in the 3rd era). The whole game feels as though you&apos;re actually trying to build and evolve a colony making the theme feel rich. There is quite a bit of interaction mainly based in blocking positions on the hex board. I&apos;ve only played at 2 players which has actually played quite quickly for an epic game, just over 4 hrs. There are ALOT of components so an organization and set up method is very important, I use plano boxes but there is a great insert on Etsy as well. Highly recommend if you enjoy an epic evolving engine builder.**Revised**Becomes repetitive, last era doesn&apos;t feel developed"/>

                     value="I like the idea of this game but in practice it&apos;s just not for me. It&apos;s just waaaay too long while also having no arc to it. You&apos;re doing the exact same thing in Era 4 as you were in Era 1 except with a more varied set of resources. It also makes the game super fiddly. The other major issue for me is it&apos;s VERY multiplayer solitaire which for a game of this length just isn&apos;t something I&apos;m interested in. I do like the planning and varied colonies that add in new strategies. Being long and “epic” doesn’t make it better. [i]Why This Is No Longer In The Collection:[/I] Fairly self-explanatory. It’s length and extremely dry gameplay means it would never see the light of day again if it stayed in my collection. "/>

                    value="Brian and I played this and only this for our Friday game night. Brian won 237-231 but got about 25-30 extra points due to a rule error we both had about how to raze and change out buildings. I enjoyed this and would play it again, but only ever at 2-player. Our game took, after set-up (40 minutes) and going through the rules together (1 hour) about 3 and a half hours. We played the full 4 era game. It takes the basic of Euro design (upgrade workers, upgrade goods, goods are VP at end of game, etc.) and ramps up the time it takes to do these things. This works to it&apos;s detriment as it literally takes you an hour to start getting your engine going. There were things I liked about the game. I enjoyed the tile placement each round. The start player (which stays the same unless you take an action to change it) connects 3 tiles at the end of a round which were revealed at the beginning of the round. You can set up chains of useful tiles for yourself. I also liked the improvement cards. They added end game scoring, cheaper build actions and more but didn&apos;t seem game breaking like a lot of card decks I see in other Euro games. I also really liked the Guilds in the game. 4 come out in the beginning and you can earn prestige within each one which grants additional special abilities. Brian went heavy in the Trader&apos;s Guild, while I upgraded my Lords guild, which let me take any good I wanted instead of a tile action when I moved.Things I didn&apos;t like: STORAGE!!! The game forces you into a jam with storing your goods. Luckily for us, we also had the Storekeeper guild which adds storage to your board as you gain prestige with them. Some of the later buildings require 8 or 9 goods to build so you will need to get at least 2-3 storage upgrades throughout the game. Also, I wasn&apos;t a big fan of the rules about moving goods. It seemed contrived to me. You can only move goods before actions and only to certain areas of your board. Weird. I also wasn&apos;t a fan of the extremely complicated rules for upgrading and razing buildings. As I mentioned earlier, that was a big deal for Brian in our game. Essentially, you have to have a worker on the building (so not anywhere else working for you) to raze it or upgrade it. And you can only move workers back to the buildings at the end of a year. Brian&apos;s whole strategy revolved around upgrading his buildings to money making ones and this was problematic for him as well. This could have been done more elegantly. So in the end, I think I will hold onto this for now but I think I will end up trading or selling it at some point. "/>

Look at my other games for sale; the combine shipping would only be the one largest shipping cost plus about $1 to $3 per additional small to large game.&amp;#10;   MASSACHUSETTS: Local buyers may pick up orders of $25 or more in person, in Billerica or Cambridge.&amp;#10;   INTERNATIONAL: International shipping, for a normal-size game, is at least $45!  Only if you understand that, you could ask me for an exact shipping quote before ordering.&amp;#10;   INSURANCE: You may add $1.35 for optional insurance.  (Otherwise, I\'ll just get Delivery Confirmation, but in the unlikely event that USPS lost or damaged the package, it would unfortunately be your loss.)"/>
